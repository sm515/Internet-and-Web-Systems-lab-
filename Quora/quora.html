	 <h3><b>Have you ever cried at the airport?</b></h3><br>

	<h4> Guilty as charged.

London Heathrow, September, 2012:

First, I need to give a little background info.

In 2009 I was working in Bangkok. As well as my normal job, j had set up a business with a British partner. To cut a long story short, he screwed me over. I found myself arrested on charges of fraud. Basically, he wanted the business all to himself, and getting rid of me was the only way to achieve that. This was the best method in his eyes.

I spent three months in Chiang Mai prison until I cleared my name.

Guilty or not, it's standard procedure in Thailand for foreigners to be deported should they find themselves in criminal proceedings. Summarily, I found myself on a plane to the UK in December 2009 - one of the coldest winters in history - with nothing more than a bag of clothes. I'd lost everything.

I found a job cleaning industrial machinery at night time in a factory. I saved enough money to buy a suit and got a better job selling utilities door-to-door for a major power supplier.

I then saved enough money to have a website built and started my business. I knew that having a regular job would mean I'd never have enough money to be able to see my son in the Philippines, and that was not an acceptable situation to me.

	 <h3><b>How is Satvat Jagwani performing in IIT?</b></h3><br>

	 <h4>I heared from a physics teacher in Kota who taught him during his JEE preparation that he is not able cope up with computer science in IIT BOMBAY,he scores 5 to 6 cgpa only and this is very low. From his childhood he is intrested in physics , he can solve many tough calculations in mind.But he takes computer science in IIT Bombay .I think because of the trend of IIT toppers to take CSE in IIT BOMBAY.

He visited Kota recently in his coaching where he had done his JEE coaching Bansal Classes.He is moving to foreign but I exactly don't know why he is moving to foreign? May be to pursue in physics or internship.He said during his visit to Kota that “ Desh ke bhar to Gandhiji bhi gaye the”.Let me share you some photos when he visited to Bansal Classes Kota. </h4><br>
